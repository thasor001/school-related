ARCHITECTURE

A computer arcitecture is composed of a CPU (with Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and registers), 
memory and I/O. It can be classified as either a *von Neumann architecture* if data and instructions share
communication lines (buses) and memory, or a *Harvard/modifier Harvard architecture* if the communication lines (buses)
are separate for data and instructions. The CPU also a clock that generates pulses typically every nanosecond or so,
and this is what makes the CPU actually "do stuff". A CPU does things typically every nanosecond,
which means it does a billion (a thousend million) things every second.

ยง CPU
  - Central Processing Unit - The main processor. This is the computer's "brain", and is the hardware component
    responsible for executing machine instructions
	
	* MMU
	  Memory managment Unit - A key component that allows each running program get its own memory area.
	  
	* CU
	  Control Unit - controls the data flow and does all the preparations necessary for the ALU to execute 
	  instructions.

	* ALU
	  Arithmetic Logic Unit - executes arithmetic or logical instructions on binary numbers.

	* Registers
	  The smallest and fastest storeage in the computer (typically 8 to 64 bits are stored here)
	  
	  - AX, BX, CX, DX, SP, BP, SI, DI
	    Data registers - stores variables, arguments, return values, etc.
	  - IP/PC (Instruction Pointer/Program counter)
	    Contains the address to the next instruction to be loaded from memory and executed.
	  - IR (Instruction Register)
	    contains the instruction that will be executed by the ALU.
	  - SP (Stack Pointer)
	    contains the address to the top of the stack.
	  - BP (Base Pointer/frame Pointer)
	    contains the address to the bottom of the current stack fram (the stack is divided into stack frames,
	    a stack fram is created when you execute a function call and it is deleted when you return from the
	    function)
	  - FLAG/PSW (Flag register/Program Status Word)
	    contains control(status information. Two examples:
	    1. one bit contains the result from a comparison intsruction (were the contents of two registers equal
	    or not?") if such an instruction has just been executed by the ALU, 2. two different bits indicates
	    if the running program is running in user mode or kernel mode.

ยง Memory/RAM
  - Random Access Memory - The main memory of the computer. Programs are loaded into memory and they contain
    *instructions and data*. Everything is stored as bits in memory.

ยง I/O - devices
  - I/O devices are connected to the computer's central bus, and are used by the CPU to get information out and in
    of the computer. These devices normally consist of a separate "small computer" which is called a "controller"
    that has a processor, some memory, some software (firmware) and some interfaces (its own register that the CPU
    can write or read from). An example of a I/O decive is the hard drive (or SSD) which has a comtroller the CPU
    can "talk to", and it has an actual storage device behind the controller.

REGISTER
  - A register can be used in 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit version. if you see a register starting with "r" you
    know it's the 64-bit version (e.g. rax, rip, rsp), if it starts with "e" it's the 32-bit version (e.g. eax, 
    eip, esp). We rarely see the 16-bit versions (e.g. AX) or 8-bit versions (e.g. AH-AL) today.

ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
