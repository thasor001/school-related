Menu:
M - Multiply circles by 10x, there can be a max of 100 circles before,
collisions with other circles are turned off due to performance,
maximum of 10000 circles again due to performance. Spawned circles sometimes,
spawn into each other and get stuck.

D - Deletes all circles except first one and assignment shapes. collisional re-turned on again.

R - Release controlled Circle, controlled circles are colored red and move,
towards the cursor.

H - Draw assignment shapes.

Right Click - Control Circle, controlled circles are colored Red and move,
towards the cursor. Controlled circles Do not collide with anything.

Left Click - Click on two different x and y positions, creates a line between them.
