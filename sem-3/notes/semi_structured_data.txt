Semi-structured data
 * Organized in semantic entities
 * similat entities are grouped together
 * entities in same group may not habe same attributes
 * order of attributes not necessarily important
 * not all attributes may be required
 * size of same attributes in a group may differ
 * type of same attributes in a group may differ

 Integration of databases
  * similar and different schemas

 Information share on the Web
  * e.g. JSON

 Flexible: irregular structure, evolves rapidly
  * add new attributes freely
  * empty values
  * new relationships without needing to change a schema
