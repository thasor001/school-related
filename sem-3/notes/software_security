Software Security

Spoofing
 Spoffing a process on the same maching
   Creating a file before the real precess does
   Renaming or linking a precess
 Spoofing a file
   Creating a file extension (exe, lib, or conf)
 Spoofing a machine
   ARP spoofing, IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, IP redirect

Tampering
 Tampering with a file
   Attacker modifies a file you own, or a file you rely on
   Attaker modifies links or redirects
 Tampering with memory
   Attacker modifoes your code (if runninh at the same privilege level)
   Attacker modifies data they supply to your API, agter security checks
 Tampering with a network
   Modify data flow over the network, or redirect to attacker's machine
   It enhances spoofing attaks

Repuditation an action
  Claiming to have not done an action
  Claming to habe not recived
  Claming to habe been a fraud victim
  Using the account of someone else

Attacking the logs
  Putting a fake attack signature in the logs to confise auditing functionality

Information disclosure
  Extract memory addresses
  Extract Secrets from error messages
  Extract machine or personal/business secrets from error cases
Information disclosure against data stores
  Making afvatage og weak or missing access control
  Making advantage of bad database premission
  Finging and learning about files, crypto kets, or file name on the server
  Reading files at they move aroun the network
  Getting data from logs, temp files, swap or obtaned device
Information disclosure against a data flow
  Reading data on the network, or by analyzing traggic
  redirecting traffic to rea data on the network
  Learning who is communicating with whom by watching the DNS or a social network

Denial of service against a process
  Consuming memory (RAM or disk)
  Consuming CPU and processing capabilities
Denial of service against a data store
  Filling up the data store with spurious data
  Making request flooding to slow down the system
Denial of service against data flows
  Consuming network resources
  Consuming communication resources inside a machine


Elevation of privilage against a process by corrupting it
  Sending input that the code does not hangle properly
  Gaining unauthorized access to read or write memory
Elevation of privilages against a process by taking advantafe of authorization failures
