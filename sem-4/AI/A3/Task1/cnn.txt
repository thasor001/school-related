Convelutional layer.
Use a kernel to go through the image matrix and take the dot product of the two, saving the result
in a new image matrix


Pooling (Max pooling).
Go through a image matrix with another one, only keep the biggest values and output that to a new
martix. This is done to keep the most important parts but reduce the size and therefor speed up the
computations later. Also it helps with overfitting.


1. remove unecessary colors, if not done already.

2. Normailize dataset, this is donebecuase big ranges can create arge weight updates 
   when backpropagating

3.
