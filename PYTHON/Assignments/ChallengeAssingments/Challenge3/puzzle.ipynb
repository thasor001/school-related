    "First a few comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that exhaustive search is a viable approach to solving these problems, but we are not interested in such solutions. We want you to learn how to implement backtracking. Backtracking is something we use when exhaustive search is not viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although it might seem that we are solving silly puzzles for fun, the methods here are strong and are applicable to serious real world problems. Many real world problems can be thought of as solving a logical puzzle. If you are interested look up \"constraint satisfaction problems\" on the internet.\n",

When we place tiles on the grid, neighbours should have different labels. To summarise, a possible solution is a selection of numbers $n_i$ and a placement of tiles on a grid, where the constraint is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $n_i \\leq n_j$ if $i<j$.\n",
    "- there are $n_i$ tiles with label $i$.\n",
    "- $\\sum_i n_i = a^2$ (so that we can fill in the grid with tiles).\n",
    "- if two tiles are neighbours on the grid, then they have different labels\n",
    "\n",
    "So for instance, when $a=2$, we need to solve the problem number of tiles with labels corresponding to the sums $1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+3, 2+2$ and $4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For $a=3$, we need to consider $30$ different label counts, corresponding to different ways to write $3\\cdot 3 = 9$ as a sum of positive integers. $9, 1+8, 2+7, 1+1+7$ are four of these possible $30$. For $a=4$, there are $231$ different ways to write $4^2=16$ as a sum of positive integers. For $a=5$ there are $1958$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The printout from the program should be something like\n",
    "\n",
    "for a = 2, and 4 = 4, there are 0 solutions,\n",
    "\n",
    "for a = 2, and 1 + 3 = 4, there are 0 solutions,\n",
    "\n",
    "for a = 2, and 2 + 2 = 4, there are 2 solutions, \n",
    "\n",
    "for a = 2, and 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, there are 4 solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "for a = 2, and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, there are 24 solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "for a = 3, and 9 = 9, there are 0 solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "for a = 3, and 1 + 8 = 9, there are ....  (and so on) \n",
    "\n",
    "....\n",
    "\n",
    "For full score the program should be able to continue to run and give more answers for higher and higher $a$.\n",
    "\n"
