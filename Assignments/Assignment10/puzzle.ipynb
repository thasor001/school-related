    "The goal of this assignment is to guide you through the solution of a puzzle using python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method you will be implementing is called backtracking (\"tilbakesporing\" in Norwegian). It is not strictly speaking an algorithm, since the details in the implementation varies a lot from problem to problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first be working on a very simple problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a few comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that exhaustive search is a viable approach to solving these problems, but we are not interested in such solutions. We want you to learn how to implement backtracking. Backtracking is something we use when exhaustive search is not viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although it might seem that we are solving silly puzzles for fun, the methods here are strong and are applicable to serious real world problems. Many real world problems can be thought of as solving a logical puzzle. If you are interested look up \"constraint satisfaction problems\" on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have divided up the assignment in a part we want everyone to do, and a part which should be thought of as one of the challenge assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a quick review of some python that you could use. Most of this should be quite familiar by now. We don't say that you have to use this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not import any other external libraries for this assignment. We will however need deepcopy from copy.\n",
