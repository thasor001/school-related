    "\n",
    "We will look at a collection of a few functions which allow you to solve problems in a more \"functional\" style (as opposed to the imperative style you likely are most used to).  There are quite a few of these, so we will only look at some of them:\n",

    "A common feature is that they are all lazy. They also what are called \"functors\", i.e. they follow the pattern where they take a function and a container and does something by applying the function on the elements of the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, writing code with these functions is not very pythonic, and in many cases plain old list comprehension feels better.\n",
